Q. I can't select a theme, i can't select my language.
A. If you have a FAT32 partition on your USB HDD, WiiFlow will use it instead of your SD.
So you can either :
- Install WiiFlow on your HDD
- Or copy wiiflow.ini to SD:/WiiFlow/ and modify the line "data_on_usb=yes"
With "data_on_usb=no", the SD card will take priority over the USB HDD.


Q. Can it play background music?
A. Put your OGG files in /wiiflow/music/


Q. It crashed when i tried to download covers.
A. There is a bug in IOS 249 that makes it crash when your internet connection doesn't work.
Check that your Wii actually is connected to the internet.


Q. When i launch 2 games in a row it freezes.
A. Don't use the IOS 249 rev13. Install rev14 or higher instead.
If you already have rev14, please try to reinstall it cleanly.
You can also use the IOS 222.


Q. The Wii freezes when i leave a game.
A. Disable "Block IOS reload".


Q. The theme Nihonflow doesn't display accents correcty.
A. It's a theme made for Japanese people, with a font that supports their alphabet.
But it's good in English too, and you can replace the font in /wiiflow/themes/nihonflow/


Q. How do i disable sounds?
A. In the settings menu, there's a page with sound volume adjustments.
If you set a volume to 0, the sounds won't be loaded/played.


Q. How can i download covers in my language?
A. If you are Portuguese or if your Wii is not set to use your language, you need to modify wiiflow.ini
In the URL, replace {loc} by your country code (see wiitdb.com for country codes)


Q. How do video modes work?
A. There are 2 ways of forcing a video mode : the "normal" way and the patch.
If the normal way doesn't work, use the patch, but it might cause wrong screen coordinates in games.
To force a video mode the normal way, set :
- Video Mode : PAL 60 or PAL 50 or NTSC
- Video Mode Patch : None
To force a video mode through a patch, set :
- Video Mode : PAL 60 or PAL 50 or NTSC
- Video Modes Patch : Normal or More or All
"Normal" means it will only patch video modes that have the same resolution as the one you've selected.
"More" means it will patch every video mode as long as its mode (interlaced or progressive) is the same.
"All" means it replaces any mode it finds.
There is another way to use the video modes patch. Set :
- Video Mode : Auto Patch
- Video Modes Patch : None (ignored anyway)
This time it tries to patch video modes the best way for you.


Q. What's the red hand?
A. See "How does the parental control work?"


Q. How does the parental control work?
A. The parental control is disabled by default.
Go to the settings menu and click on "Set Code".
Enter a 4 digits code.
Now that there is a code, WiiFlow will switch to child mode on next start.
To immediately enable it, go back to the coverflow and press B+Home.
With child mode enabled, many functions become invisible.
If you want to enable these functions again, go to the settings menu, click "Unlock", and type the same code.
Now, you can go to game selection, and click on the red hand to select which games should be invisible in child mode.
If you launch a game or restart WiiFlow, it will automatically switch back to child mode.
To remove the child mode persitently, go to the settings menu, click "Unlock", type your code, then click "Set code", then "Erase".


Q. I've found a bug.
A. Try to find an open source project based on WiiFlow and tell them about the bug.
